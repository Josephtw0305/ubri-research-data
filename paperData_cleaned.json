    "Author": "Vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) are increasingly commonplace, partly due to the popularity of electric vehicles and the digitalization of cities. Data collected and shared in VANETs include traffic-related information, such as those relating to real-time traffic situations and road works. In recent times, there has been a trend of moving away from a centralized approach to a decentralized approach, for example, using Blockchain to facilitate secure data sharing and traceability of critical information. Hence, in this paper, we comprehensively survey the existing literature on blockchain-based VANET systems, focusing on the application of different blockchain technologies in different contexts, as well as the associated challenges and research opportunities.",

IntroductionCryptocurrencies are online payment networks in which the veriﬁcation of transactions (andtherefore the safeguard of system consistency) is decentralised and does not require a trusted thirdparty, thanks to the clever combination of cryptographic technologies [1].
